# Lab 5 â€“ Refugee Stats using Dictionaries
## Summary 
This code creates a dictionary of countries and their total refugee camp populations, taken from this Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp). I added up the populations for each refugee camp within a country for 2014. 
This code then prints the names of the countries, the population of refugees in each country, and then a statement telling you  how many refugees are in each country. The first two parts of the code are functions, and the print statements use a `for` loop. 
## Errors? 
I did not encounter any  erros while writing this code. I referenced the lecture notes and exercieses for help with syntax for dictionaries.
